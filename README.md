# Test project for tetra forms

This is just a temporary testing project to test the functionality of tetra forms.
Don't bother bookmarking it. It will be deleted right after correct working form support and incorporated into `tetra.tests`.

## Installation

```bash
virtualenv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install tetra  # you may have to install the development version or a branch
pip install -e .

npm install
```

Run

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
